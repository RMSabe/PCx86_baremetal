This are test routines created to test some features.
To run a test, simply use the "%include" directive to include any of the test.asm files in this folder right after the "sys_main" label in kernel.asm
Only one test.asm file may be included to kernel.asm. Including multiple test files in the sys_main routine may cause random behavior or assembler errors
