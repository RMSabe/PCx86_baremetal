Assembler instructions:
Only "boot.asm" and "kernel.asm" must be assembled individually.
All other ".asm" files are included in "kernel.asm".
I used the NASM assembler to assemble these files. Output format should be raw binary.
Binary kernel file should be concatenated right after binary boot file
